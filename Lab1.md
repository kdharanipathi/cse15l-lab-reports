## Step 1: Installing VS Code

The first thing you want to do when do this is go the VS code website and download the app. Be 
sure to pick the right operating system based on the computer you are working on. 

Here is the link to install the software: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

**Here is what it looks like on Mac after downloading.**

## Step 2: Remotely Connecting

Next we want to log in remotely. To do this we need to log into out CSE specfic account. If you are using Windows you need to install a program call OpenSHH, but since we are working on Mac we will not be installing that account. Next we are going back to VS code to connect the remote computer. 

We have to first open the terminal and type in our email after shh. This is what it should look like. 

`$ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
